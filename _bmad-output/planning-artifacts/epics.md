# local-food - Epic Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for local-food, decomposing the requirements from the PRD and Architecture requirements into implementable stories. No UX design contract exists for this feature set (no consumer/UX-heavy surface — confirmed during PRD Discovery).

## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements

FR1: Customer can remove a cart line item and see an accurate total. **Already implemented** (`CartProvider.removeItem`) — ships as a verification/regression task, not new development.
FR2: The system restricts admin capabilities (vendor management, cross-vendor product management, inventory report/alerts) to users holding the Admin role, and attributes admin actions to the acting admin.
FR3: Admin adds a new Vendor to the platform, with friendly slug-collision handling.
FR4: Admin deactivates a Vendor (soft-delete) — storefront shows unavailable, no new orders placeable, but existing in-flight orders keep fulfilling and no data is deleted.
FR6: Out-of-stock (zero Stock Quantity) products are visibly marked everywhere they're displayed.
FR7: Out-of-stock products cannot be added to cart or carried through checkout; checkout re-validates stock sufficiency server-side.
FR8: Inventory updates immediately when a sale completes — stock decrements on payment confirmation (webhook), never goes negative, races resolve to one winner.
FR9: Admin can view current Stock Quantity across all vendors on demand (Inventory Report dashboard page).
FR10: Admin receives an SMS alert when a product's Stock Quantity crosses at or below its Low-Stock Threshold, once per crossing event.
FR11: Customer can adjust a cart line's quantity in place via a stepper (floor 1, ceiling = available stock).
FR12: Stock Quantity is captured at product creation and backfilled for every pre-existing Product (isAvailable:true → 100, isAvailable:false → 0).
FR13: Vendor is notified via a dashboard banner of any Product still at the placeholder Stock Quantity, prompting an update; banner clears on any edit.

*(FR5 is retired — "admin adds products" was confirmed to mean the existing vendor self-service `AddProductForm`, already implemented, no new work. Not listed as a build FR.)*

### NonFunctional Requirements

NFR1: Stock Quantity changes (decrement, threshold check) must be consistent under concurrent orders — no overselling the last unit (FR-8, FR-11).
NFR2: Server-side state is authoritative everywhere client state could be stale or manipulated — checkout re-validates stock sufficiency and vendor-active status regardless of client display (FR-7, FR-4).
NFR3: A failed SMS send is never recorded as delivered (mirrors existing `smsNotified` discipline) — applies to the low-stock alert (FR-10).
NFR4: No new external dependency is introduced — Admin auth reuses Clerk, stock alerts reuse the existing SMS module, no new library.

### Additional Requirements

- No starter template applies — brownfield app, existing Next.js 14 App Router codebase ratified as-is (Architecture Design Paradigm).
- Prisma schema changes: new `Admin` model (`clerkUserId` unique); `Vendor` gains `deletedAt`, `createdByAdminId`, `deletedByAdminId`, and `clerkUserId` becomes nullable; `Product` gains `stockQuantity`, `lowStockThreshold`, `lowStockAlerted` and drops `isAvailable`; `Vendor → Product` and `Vendor → Order` drop `onDelete: Cascade` (AD-1, AD-2, AD-4, AD-5, AD-8).
- Migration ordering constraint: `stockQuantity` must be backfilled for every existing Product *before* `isAvailable` is dropped (AD-2).
- New `src/lib` service functions: `getCurrentAdmin()` (AD-1/AD-6), `adjustStock()` + `PLACEHOLDER_STOCK_QUANTITY` constant (AD-3/AD-9), `assertVendorActive()` (AD-4, throws `VendorDeactivatedError`), `resolveVendorSlug()` (AD-7).
- New route tree `src/app/admin/**` (`vendors/`, `inventory/`), separate from vendor's `src/app/dashboard/**`; every new admin route must be added to `middleware.ts`'s `isProtectedRoute` matcher (AD-6).
- Existing routes requiring modification: `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` (stock sufficiency check, `assertVendorActive()`), `src/app/api/webhooks/*` (call `adjustStock()` on payment confirmation), `src/app/dashboard/products/page.tsx` (drop direct `isAvailable` read, add FR-13 banner), storefront listing/detail pages (availability display).
- Multi-item order stock decrements run inside one DB transaction — all lines succeed or none do; a post-payment shortfall is flagged for manual admin review, not auto-resolved (AD-3, Deferred: auto-refund out of scope).

### UX Design Requirements
